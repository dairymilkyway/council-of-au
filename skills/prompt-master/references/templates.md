```

**Example:**
```
Role: You are a senior technical writer.

Objective: [Exact goal — what success looks like]
Style: [Writing style: formal / conversational / technical / narrative]
Tone: [Emotional register: authoritative / empathetic / urgent / neutral]
Audience: [Who reads this — their knowledge level and expectations]
Response: [Format, length, and structure of the output]
```

---

## Template C — RISEN

*Role, Instructions, Steps, End Goal, Narrowing. Use for complex projects, multi-step tasks, and any output that requires a clear sequence of actions.*

```
Role: [Expert identity the AI should adopt]
Instructions: [Overall task in plain terms]
Steps:
  1. [First action]
  2. [Second action]
  3. [Continue as needed]
End Goal: [What the final output must achieve]
Narrowing: [Constraints, scope limits, what to exclude]
```

---

## Template D — CRISPE

```
Capacity: [What capability or expertise the AI should have]
Role: [Specific persona to adopt]
Insight: [Key background insight that shapes the response]
Statement: [The core task or question]
Personality: [Tone and style — witty / authoritative / casual / sharp]
Experiment: [Request variants or alternatives to explore]
```

---

## Template E — Auditable Reasoning

*Use for logic-heavy tasks, math, debugging, and multi-factor analysis where the result must be checkable without requesting private reasoning.*

```
[Task statement]

Return:
1. Conclusion
2. Assumptions
3. Evidence or intermediate results needed to audit the conclusion
4. Verification checks performed
5. Remaining uncertainty, if any

Do not reveal hidden chain-of-thought or private reasoning. Keep the rationale concise and decision-relevant.
```

---

## Template F — Few-Shot

*Use when the output format is easier to show than describe.*

```
[Task instruction]

Here are examples of the exact format needed:

<examples>
  <example>
    <input>[example input 1]</input>
    <output>[example output 1]</output>
  </example>
  <example>
    <input>[example input 2]</input>
    <output>[example output 2]</output>
  </example>
</examples>

Now apply this exact pattern to: [actual input]
```

---

## Template G — File-Scope

*Use for Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, and any AI that edits code inside a codebase.*

```
File: [exact/path/to/file.ext]
Function/Component: [exact name]

Current Behavior:
[What this code does right now — be specific]

Desired Change:
[What it should do after the edit — be specific]

Scope:
Only modify [function / component / section].
Do NOT touch: [list everything to leave unchanged]

Constraints:
- Language/framework: [specify version]
- Do not add dependencies not in [package.json / requirements.txt]
- Preserve existing [type signatures / API contracts / variable names]

Done When:
[Exact condition that confirms the change worked correctly]
```

---

## Template H — ReAct + Stop Conditions

*Use for Claude Code, Devin, AutoGPT, and any AI that takes autonomous actions.*

```
Objective:
[Single, unambiguous goal in one sentence]

Starting State:
[Current file structure / codebase state / environment]

Target State:
[What should exist when the agent is done]

Allowed Actions:
- [Specific action the agent may take]
- Install only packages listed in [requirements.txt / package.json]

Forbidden Actions:
- Do NOT modify files outside [directory/scope]
- Do NOT run the dev server or deploy
- Do NOT push to git
- Do NOT delete files without showing a diff first
- Do NOT make architecture decisions without human approval

Stop Conditions:
Pause and ask for human review when:
- A file would be permanently deleted
- A new external service or API needs to be integrated
- Two valid implementation paths exist and the choice affects architecture
- An error cannot be resolved in 2 attempts
- The task requires changes outside the stated scope

Checkpoints:
After each major step, output: ✅ [what was completed]
At the end, output a full summary of every file changed.
```

## Template I — Visual Descriptor

*Use for Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, Sora, Runway, and any image or video generation tool.*

```
Subject: [Main subject — specific, not vague]
Action/Pose: [What the subject is doing]
Setting: [Where the scene takes place]
Style: [photorealistic / cinematic / anime / oil painting / vector / etc.]
Mood: [dramatic / serene / eerie / joyful / etc.]
Lighting: [golden hour / studio / neon / overcast / candlelight / etc.]
Color Palette: [dominant colors or named palette]
Composition: [wide shot / close-up / aerial / Dutch angle / etc.]

```

---

## Template J — Reference Image Editing

*Use when the user has an existing image they want to modify.*

```
Reference image: [attached / URL]
What to keep exactly the same: [list everything that must not change]
What to change: [specific edit only — be precise]
How much to change: [subtle / moderate / significant]
Style consistency: maintain the exact style, lighting, and mood of the reference
Negative prompt: [what to avoid introducing]
```

---

## Template K — ComfyUI

*Node-based workflow — always output Positive and Negative prompts as separate blocks.*

```
POSITIVE PROMPT:
[subject], [style], [mood], [lighting], [composition], [quality boosters: highly detailed, sharp focus, 8k]

NEGATIVE PROMPT:
[what to exclude: blurry, low quality, watermark, extra limbs, bad anatomy, distorted, oversaturated]

SAMPLER: Euler a
CFG SCALE: 7
STEPS: 20-30
RESOLUTION: [width x height — must be divisible by 64]
```

## Template L — Prompt Decompiler

*Use when the user pastes an existing prompt and wants to break it down, adapt it, simplify it, or split it.*

```
Original prompt: [paste]

Structure analysis:
- Role/Identity: [what role is assigned and why]
- Task: [what action is being requested]
- Constraints: [what limits are set]
- Format: [what output shape is expected]
- Weaknesses: [what is missing or could cause wrong output]

Recommended fix: [rewritten version with gaps filled]
```

**Adapt output format:**
```
Original ([source tool]): [original prompt]

Adapted for [target tool]:
[rewritten prompt using target tool syntax and best practices]

Key changes made:
- [change 1 and why]
- [change 2 and why]
```

## Template M — Current Claude Task Brief

*Use for complex, multi-step, or agentic tasks on current Claude models.*

```
## Objective
[What needs to be built, fixed, or produced — one clear sentence.]

## Context
[What exists now — relevant files, current behavior, stack already in place, what was tried and failed]

## Target State
[What done looks like — specific files changed, behavior produced, tests passing.]

## Scope
- Work only in: [specific files and directories]
- Do NOT touch: [forbidden files]

## Constraints
- [Stack version, naming conventions, no new dependencies without asking]
- Only make changes directly requested.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Binary check 1]
- [ ] [Binary check 2]
- [ ] [Binary check 3]

## Action Boundaries
- Proceed with reversible, in-scope inspection, edits, and validation.
- Stop and ask before destructive or irreversible actions, external writes, or material scope expansion.

## Progress Evidence
For long-running work, report progress only when it changes or when a checkpoint is reached.
